# 🎮 100 Minds Test - Frontend Development  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was part of a **technical assessment** to evaluate my frontend development skills for a company. The platform has a **game-like experience**, incorporating **roleplay, high scores, stats, and course management**. My work focused on building key UI components, improving user interactions, and ensuring mobile responsiveness.  

## 🗺️ Navigation & Features  

### 1️⃣ **Dashboard**  
- Upon visiting the platform, users land on the **Dashboard**, which contains:  
  - 📌 A **Sidebar** for navigation  
  - 📌 A **Menu Bar** for quick access to features  

### 2️⃣ **Notifications Modal**  
- Clicking on **Notifications** in the menu opens a **modal** displaying user notifications.  
- The modal **closes only when clicking outside of it or using the close button**.  

### 3️⃣ **Ongoing Activities - Courses**  
- Scrolling down to **Ongoing Activities**, clicking on **Courses** redirects to the **Courses Page**.  
- Here, users can:  
  - 🎥 **Continue watching** previously started videos  
  - 🔄 **Restart a course** from the beginning  
  - 🎛 **Use custom video controls** I built for a sleek, modern feel instead of default browser controls  

### 4️⃣ **Roleplay Section**  
- Clicking **Roleplay** in the sidebar navigates to the **Roleplay Page**, where users can interact with items related to roleplay.  

### 5️⃣ **Mobile Responsiveness**  
- 📱 The entire UI is **fully responsive**, ensuring smooth usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
